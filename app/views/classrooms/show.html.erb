<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call out all the students in each class:
<% Classroom.all.each do |classes| %>
  <% classes.students.each do |student| %>
    <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
